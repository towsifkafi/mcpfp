# `mcpfp-api`
</div>


This project is an API server designed to generate cute profile pictures from Minecraft skins. It's based on [**mcpfp**](https://github.com/MauritsWilke/mcpfp) by **MauritsWilke**, with additional features like overlays and cosmetics.

Also this project utilizes **ðŸ”¥ Hono** and **ðŸ«“ Bun** along with [`@napi-rs/canvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/canvas) (instead of skia-canvas) resulting in faster performance.

## Installation
**Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed**. Install from: https://bun.sh/

Clone the repository from the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/towsifkafi/mcpfp.git
cd mcpfp
```
Then install the required the dependencies:
```bash
bun install --cwd ./api
bun install --cwd ./web
``` 
Also, you need to build the static webpages before running the dev server:
```bash
bun run --cwd ./web build
```

Now you can start the dev server:
```bash
bun run --cwd ./api dev
```

But if you want to run this API server in production, you have to build the server & you can use the `pm2.config.js` using pm2.
```bash
pm2 start pm2.config.js
```
Or if you would like to use Docker:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
